Welcome to EasyScript!

This is not complete just started the progject. Note: You can help me in the project and use it in most projects but you must credit me as this is still under development

EasyScript Language is a new and innovative scripting language designed specifically for C#. It aims to provide users with a straightforward and user-friendly experience, making it easy for both beginners and experienced developers to create scripts effortlessly. While it is still under development, we are excited about the potential it offers.

One of the key features we are working on is package compatibility. EasyScript will support popular frameworks and engines, such as the Unity Engine, allowing users to seamlessly integrate their scripts into various projects. This compatibility will enhance the versatility of EasyScript, making it an ideal choice for game development and other applications.

Additionally, we plan to introduce custom themes that will allow users to personalize their scripting experience. This feature will enhance usability and give developers the ability to tailor the interface to their preferences.

We invite you to be a part of this exciting journey! Your feedback and contributions can help shape EasyScript into a powerful tool for the community. Join me in developing EasyScript Language and to make tutorials on how to use it.

Note: You need C# to develop with us because this is the language that this scripting language is made in C# and optionally Discord and JSON for coding custom themes. Although you need discord to chat with me and the group, JSON is only required to code custom themes, JSON is built-in any system so don't worry much about JSON if you want to code custom themes.
